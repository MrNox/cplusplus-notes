The compiler produces similar code for reference and pointer but at compile time, references provide some safety to avoid
null pointers.
void foobar(int& a);


# Intermangling C and C++

The calling conventions in the C and C++ code could potentially be mismatched, and C++ compilers emit different symbols than C compilers do because C++ compilers assist by decorating the object aka decorated name due function overloads, calling conventions, namespace usage, is added as encode informatoin by C++ compiler through decoration.
